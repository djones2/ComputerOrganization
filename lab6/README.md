A cache simulator.  This simulator will model 7 different cache configurations and print out the number 
of hits and the hit rate and simulate the following cache configurations (using LRU when appropriate and 
the cache is byte addressable):

- 2KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks
- 2KB, direct mapped, 2-word blocks
- 2KB, direct mapped, 4-word blocks
- 2KB, 2-way set associative, 1-word blocks
- 2KB, 4-way set associative, 1-word blocks
- 2KB, 4-way set associative, 4-word blocks
- 4KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks
