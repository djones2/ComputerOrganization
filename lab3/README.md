A MIPS emulator which will model the execution of instructions on a MIPS CPU. This program will work like SPIM (a program that executes assembly commands) in that it will emulate the state of the registers and memory.

This program will emulate the MIPS registers, data memory (size 8,192 items), and program counter.
