A correlating branch predictor in the MIPS simulator that obtains the branch prediction accuracy.  
Provides accuracy results for when the GHR is 2, 4, or 8 bits.  

In addition, this program implements (in MIPS assembly) the Bresenham line and circle drawing algorithms.  
These algorithms were invented by Bresenham to draw lines and circles using just integer computation.
